## Limit Break: The Chemist - 'Reactive Mending'

**Trigger:** This Limit Break charges when an ally within 30 feet is affected by a [[Elements#üß™ Chemical (CHEM)|Chemical]] spell or persistent chemical damage. It fully charges when an ally is knocked out by a [[Elements#üß™ Chemical (CHEM)|Chemical]] damage type.

**Activation (1 Action):**
You expel a cloud of glowing blue mist which dissipates quickly. All allies within a 30-foot emanation centred on you immediately cure all persistent conditions applied to them, and restore **1d6** Hit Points to themselves. This healing ignores immunity to healing. You also gain a +2 status bonus to all saving throws for 1 round as your body becomes hyper-resilient.

**GM Narration (when triggered and charged):**
"As [Ally's Name] falls, overcome by the caustic venom, a searing, *alien* heat ignites within you. It feels like the Catalyst in your veins is screaming, twisting. For a split second, you feel a horrifying, perfect control over its destructive power, accelerating cellular repair to a terrifying degree. Your body spasms, but through the pain, a clear instinct surfaces: you can **'pull the trigger'** on something incredible."

## Limit Break: The Detective - 'Precognition of Peril'

**Trigger:** This Limit Break charges when an enemy *successfully* knocks a party member down by exploiting their weakness. It fully charges if they enter the Dying state.

**Activation (1 Action):**
Your eyes momentarily glow with an eerie, voidal light. You instantly use the [[Scanning|Scan]] action against all enemies within a 15-foot emanation from any point you can see within 120 feet, rolling your [[Stats#üëÅÔ∏è Perception|Perception]] check with advantage and ignoring any penalties for failure. Additionally, for **1 round,** all allies gain a **+1 status bonus to attack rolls against any creature you successfully Scanned with this ability**, as they act upon your crucial intel.

**GM Narration (when triggered and charged):**
"As [Enemy's Name] lashes out and exploits [Ally's Name]'s vulnerability, a chilling clarity washes over you. The void thrums in your mind, whispering and twisting probabilities, showing you not what will happen, but what *could*. As you read your enemy's every move, unveiling vulnerabilities nobody else can see, you realise you are able to **'pull the trigger'** on an impossible revelation."

## Limit Break: The Adventurer - 'Ascendant Blitz'

**Trigger:** This Limit Break charges when you successfully critically hit an enemy. It fully charges after two such critical hits.

**Activation (1 Action):**
You are suffused with crackling electricity and an aura of unstoppable confidence. Until the end of your next turn, you gain a **+10 bonus to your Speed**, and you can Step twice instead of once per turn. Additionally, for the duration, you gain **Fast Healing 5 (regain 5HP when your turn starts)**. However, your intense focus on offence leaves you vulnerable: you also suffer a **‚Äì2 status penalty to AC** until the end of your next turn.

**GM Narration (when triggered and charged):**
"As your strike finds its mark with devastating precision, a jolt of pure triumph surges through your core. This is *your* moment. The spotlight finds you. Every fibre of your being screams that you are capable of extraordinary feats through sheer belief. You feel you could move with impossible _speed_, abandoning all caution for ultimate glory. You are undeniably the protagonist, and you have the power to **'pull the trigger'** on your own destiny!"

## Limit Break: The Barbarian - 'Echoes of the True Rage'

**Trigger:** This Limit Break charges when you are subjected to a powerful mental attack. It fully charges after suffering from two such mental effects.

**Activation (1 Action):**
Your eyes blaze with a terrifying, primal inferno. You immediately dispel or counteract (with a success) all [[Elements#üåÄ Psychic (PSY)|Psychic]] effects currently affecting you. Until the end of your next turn, all your Strikes deal an additional **1d6** [[Elements#üî• Fire|Fire]] damage, and you gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls against any creature that has targeted you with a [[Elements#üåÄ Psychic (PSY)|Psychic]] effect within the last round. 

**GM Narration (when triggered and charged):**
"As the psychic chaos tries to burrow into your mind, something snaps. Not your resolve, but the *lie* that has been smothering it. For a brief, terrifying instant, the cold doubt shatters. The freezing doubt that plagued you melts away, replaced by an incandescent, unyielding rage. **'Pull the trigger'** and unleash true wrath!"

## Limit Break: The Shaman - 'Divine Intercession'

**Trigger:** This Limit Break charges when an ally within 30 feet is critically hit by an attack or spell which uses [[Elements#üåå Void|Void]] damage. It fully charges after two such instances.

**Activation (1 Action):**
You stand firm, your form briefly wreathed in blinding [[Elements#‚ú® Radiant (RAD) |Radiant]] energy. All enemies within a 30-foot emanation from you take **2d6** [[Elements#‚ú® Radiant (RAD) |Radiant]] damage (basic [[Saving Throws#Fortitude|Fortitude save]]). This damage ignores resistances to radiant. Additionally, any area of magical darkness within the emanation is immediately dispelled, and for **1 round**, any creature attempting to use a [[Elements#üåå Void|Void]] effect within the emanation has disadvantage on its attack roll and grants a +2 status bonus to the saving throw for targets.

**GM Narration (when triggered and charged):**
"As the void lands a devastating blow against your ally, a new, resolute conviction solidifies within you. Faced with impossible odds and the silence of the divine, your unyielding faith hardens into a tangible force. No divine voice answers, but *your* will becomes your shield, and a conduit for pure, unwavering Radiant energy. You realise you can **'pull the trigger'** on a miracle born of your own defiance!"
