## Draw List
- `pf2:2` Ray of Frost: 1d4 cold damage to one target (120ft range)
- `pf2:1` Personal Blizzard (30ft, one target, **sustained** 1 min)
	- Your patron’s breath becomes a blizzard of obscuring, scouring ice that follows your target. The target attempts a Fortitude save.
		**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
		
		**Success** The target takes 1d6 cold damage, and the spell ends.
		
		**Failure** The target takes 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 persistent cold damage. The persistent damage automatically ends when the spell ends. It is concealed to other creatures, and other creatures are concealed to it.
			
		**Critical Failure** As failure, but both the cold damage and the persistent cold damage are 2d6.
