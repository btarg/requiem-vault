> Each Doppelganger Merc will replicate the stats of a player character, only with a **-1 penalty to every stat, and -10 to HP and AC.** They are unstable and prone to errors, reflecting a flawed creation process or intoxication.

---

## Abilities (Flawed Mimicry)

### Borrowed Bravado (Faltering Resolve)

> While they initially appear aggressive, their confidence is brittle. If a Doppelganger Merc is critically hit, witnesses another Doppelganger Merc being defeated, or suffers a critical failure on their Fumbling Spell Siphon or Erratic Spellcasting, they must make a **DC 13 Will save**.

*   **Success:** They grit their teeth and continue fighting.
*   **Failure:** They become **Frightened 1** for 1 round as its composure cracks.

### Erratic Spellcasting (Innate Spells)

> When a Doppelganger Merc casts innate spells, their control is compromised. After determining the success of the spell but before applying effects, roll a **d6**.

*   **On a 1:** The spell has an additional, minor, chaotic effect.
    *   **Live Wire**
    *   **Chain Lightning**
*   **(No special effect on 2-5)**
*   **On a 6 (for `Chain Lightning` only):** The doppelganger manages to push a bit more power through; one target of the `Chain Lightning` takes an additional \(1d6\) electricity damage.

## Actions

### Fumbling Spell Siphon (Attempted [[Drawing Spells]])

> **(1 Action)** The Doppelganger Merc targets one player character within 30 feet and attempts to [[Drawing Spells|Draw]] a spell from that player's spell inventory. The doppelganger is automatically familiar with all spells on the target's list for the purpose of selecting one to Draw. However, due to its intoxicated and flawed nature, it must first make a **DC 16 [[Saving Throws#Will|Will save]].**

#### Critical Success:

The doppelganger successfully Draw a spell of its choice from the target's list, using **1d2** instead of the usual 1d4, due to Flawed Mimicry.
### Success:

The doppelganger successfully Draws 1 spell of its choice from the target's list (max Level 1 or 2). It can cast this drawn spell on its next turn, consuming the drawn charge.

#### Failure:

The doppelganger fails to Draw any spell. It grunts in frustration and becomes **Stupefied 1** for 1 round.
#### Critical Failure:

The doppelganger fails spectacularly, taking **1d6** [[Elements#ğŸŒ€ Psychic (PSY)|Psychic]] damage and becoming **Stupefied 2** for 1 round. It cannot attempt to Draw spells again for the remainder of the encounter.

> [!TIP]
> *Flavour:* "It points a shaky finger, slurring, 'Your... your pretty spells... I'll take 'em!'"

### Mimicked Attack

> **(1 Action or as per mimicked ability)** The Doppelganger Merc uses a basic attack or simple offensive ability copied from the player character it is mimicking (e.g., Strike with a weapon, a basic damaging cantrip if the PC has one not on its innate list). Apply the -1 stat penalty to attack rolls and damage. If attempting a more complex combat action, refer to **Clumsy Imitation**.

## Spells (Innate)

1. `pf2:2` [[Live Wire]] (Cantrip)
> Conjure a whip-like length of sharp, electrified copper filament that lashes out to cut and shock your foe.
*   **Element:** âš¡ Electricity
*   *Note:* Subject to **Erratic Spellcasting**: One of the secondary arcs (if any) fizzles out with a pathetic pop, or strikes another enemy doppelganger for minimal (\(1d4\)) damage if no other valid targets are closer.

2. `pf2:2` [[Chain Lightning]] (Level 6)
> Unleash a potent bolt of lightning that strikes a primary target and then arcs to other nearby foes, shocking each in turn. (Likely usable once per encounter).
*   **Element:** âš¡ Electricity
*   *Note:* Subject to **Erratic Spellcasting**: The electricity arcs harmlessly to a nearby metallic object with a loud crackle, or the whip briefly wraps around the doppelganger's own arm, causing it to flinch (no damage, but a moment of distraction).

3. `pf2:2` [[Illusory Disguise]] (Level 1)
> Create an illusion that causes the target to appear as another creature of the same body shape. (This is their default state when encountered).
*   **Element:** [[Elements#ğŸŒ€ Psychic (PSY)|ğŸŒ€ Psychic (PSY)]]
