The room on the left of the Library seems impossibly tall. Its size in general is chimerical, as if you have entered a wholly different building. Standing proudly at its centre is a beautiful magical wellspring, each individual spell orbiting gracefully like tiny solar systems. The room is symmetrical, with five tables neatly laid out on either side on floors raised by three steps. The central aisle leads toward the mesmerising blue planets of the Draw Point, though there is evidently more to this room.

>>You notice something strange about the bookshelves... you're certain that when you first entered, said ladders were actually able to *reach* the top. On the right side, however, the ladder seems to only reach about three quarters of the way up.

>Startled by a scraping sound like claws against stone, you swiftly return to the central aisle.

>[!question]- Check the tables
>You walk up the three steps and move towards a table. Like the main hall, there are tomes left scattered on their surfaces. Luminescent particles rise from the books in small clouds, yet there is a noticeable lack of Ichor Wraiths feeding on them. *(note: call them "wisps" or something equally generic if the players don't have the knowledge)*

>>You notice something strange about the tables... on the left side, there are six tables - but on the right, there are only five. This seems eerily out-of-place for an otherwise meticulously symmetrical room.

>A sound like flapping wings from above makes you jump, and you quickly head back down the four steps, returning to the central aisle shaken.

You notice there are exactly *(four/party count)* books laid out on the tables. 

### [[The Archetypes#The Shaman|The Shaman]]'s book

The book on the table is jarringly out of place among the tomes of arcane theory and spellcraft. Its battered leather cover is embossed not with runes, but with the mundane title: _Rules of Engagement: A Realistic Role-Playing Game_.
The pages are dog-eared and stained, as if it has been read and reread by anxious hands. Skimming through its pages, you find the story of a party of *(four)* military sorcerers—uncannily similar to your own group—tasked with investigating a terrorist attack. The bookmarked page describes the party’s entry into an infinite library, its shelves twisting and shifting, trapping them in a maze that feeds on hope and fear. Whether they live or die is left entirely up to chance. Beside the book rest two small icosahedral objects. At first glance, they appear to be dice, but each of their twenty faces is painted with the numeral 1. They are cold to the touch, heavier than they should be, and their surfaces seem to absorb the light around them. The characters in the story cling to hope. They believe in miracles, in mercy, in the benevolence of their god. But the dice tell another story. There is nothing they can do. As you read, the air grows colder. The words on the page seem to shift, mirroring your own actions. For a moment, you feel as if you are being watched by the library itself.
### [[The Archetypes#The Adventurer|The Adventurer]]'s book

The book which draws your attention the most is a biography, seemingly written about a heroic sorcerer who inspired millions. Its cover is adorned with myriad awards and praise from authors and reviewers: front and centre are the words, *"Beautiful... it brought me to tears"* accompanied by five stars.
Opening the book, however, your excitement immediately dissipates. The pages are blank. You rifle through tens of pages at once, but not one of them contains a single word.
