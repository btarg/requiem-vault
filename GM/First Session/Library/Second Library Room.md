The room on the left of the Library seems impossibly tall. Its size in general is chimerical, as if you have entered a wholly different building. Standing proudly at its centre is a beautiful magical wellspring, each individual spell orbiting gracefully like tiny solar systems. The room is symmetrical, with five tables neatly laid out on either side on floors raised by three steps. The central aisle leads toward the mesmerising blue planets of the Draw Point, though there is evidently more to this room.


>[!question]- Check the bookshelves
>The bookshelves here are of ridiculous stature. There are ladders either side of the room for access to the higher shelves.

>>[!success] DC 15 Perception
>>You notice something strange about the bookshelves... you're certain that when you first entered, said ladders were actually able to *reach* the top. On the right side, however, the ladder seems to only reach about three quarters of the way up.

>Startled by a scraping sound like claws against stone, you swiftly return to the central aisle.

>[!question]- Check the tables
>You walk up the three steps and move towards a table. Like the main hall, there are tomes left scattered on their surfaces. Luminescent particles rise from the books in small clouds, yet there is a noticeable lack of Ichor Wraiths feeding on them. *(note: call them "wisps" or something equally generic if the players don't have the knowledge)*

>>[!success] DC 15 Perception
>>You notice something strange about the tables... on the left side, there are six tables - but on the right, there are only five. This seems eerily out-of-place for an otherwise meticulously symmetrical room.

>A sound like flapping wings from above makes you jump, and you quickly head back down the four steps, returning to the central aisle shaken.
