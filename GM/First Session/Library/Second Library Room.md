The room on the left of the Library feels impossibly tall, as if you have entered a wholly different building. Standing proudly at its centre is a beautiful magical wellspring, each individual spell orbiting gracefully like tiny solar systems. The room is symmetrical, with five tables neatly laid out on either side on floors raised by three steps. The central aisle leads toward the mesmerising blue planets of the Draw Point, though there is evidently more to this room.

The door slams shut behind you with a gust of wind, as it blows through the shattered stained glass window at the top of the room.

>[!question]- Examine the stained glass window
>In the place once occupied by another beautiful, ornate stained-glass window is an empty frame, lined with jagged shards, providing a view out into the night sky. It is unclear to you what caused the damage, as you recall that the one displayed proudly above the Library's main entrance has remained perfectly intact even after all these years.

>[!question]- Check the bookshelves
>The bookshelves here are of ridiculous stature. There are ladders either side of the room for access to the higher shelves.
>
>>[!success] DC 15 Perception
>>You notice something strange about the bookshelves... you're certain that when you first entered, said ladders were actually able to *reach* the top. On the right side, however, the ladder seems to only reach about three quarters of a way up, its top rung ending abruptly in empty air.
>
>Startled by a scraping sound like claws against stone, you swiftly return to the central aisle.

>[!question]- Check the tables
>You walk up three steps and move towards a table. Like the main hall, there are tomes left scattered on their surfaces. Luminescent particles rise from the books in small clouds, yet there is a noticeable lack of the wisps that fed on them before.
>
>>[!success] DC 15 Perception
>>You notice something strange about the tables... on the left side, there are six tables - but on the right, there are only five. This seems eerily out-of-place for an otherwise meticulously symmetrical room.
>
>A sound like flapping wings from above makes you jump, and you quickly head back down the four steps, returning to the central aisle shaken.

>[!question]- Attempt to leave/open the door *(available at any point)*
> When you attempt to re-open the two entrance doors by pulling them toward you and into the room, they seem jammed in place.
>>[!success]- Open with brute force (DC 10 [[Stats#⚔️ Strength|Strength]] check), or push the doors instead (no DC)
>>Although you were certain that the doors opened *into* the room, with a forceful shove they swing *outward*, into somewhere wholly unexpected. The air that spills out is cold and dead. Standing before you is not the main room of the Library, but rather an unfamiliar, impossible hallway.
>>>[!question]- Examine the hallway more closely (DC 15 [[Stats#🧠 Wisdom|Wisdom]] check)
>>>You focus on the impossible space before you, trying to reconcile it with what you know to be true.
>>>
>>>>[!failure] DC < 15
>>>>The hallway feels terrifyingly real. Its existence is an impossibility, yet your senses confirm it. The air is unnaturally still, and a profound, oppressive silence emanates from the inky-black darkness at its far end. To reach whatever lies at the end, you estimate that it would take around *five-and-a-half minutes* of walking through that suffocating void.
>>>
>>>
>>>>[!success] DC 15+
>>>>You see the trick. The darkness isn't real; it doesn't absorb light, it *is* an absence of it. You notice a faint, shimmering quality at the edges of the corridor, like heat haze, and the silence isn't natural—it's a psychic dead zone. This is a powerful illusion, a projection meant to deceive and mislead. You know that with enough conviction, you could likely walk right through it.
>>>>>[!question]- Push through the illusion
>>>>>Trusting your senses, you step forward into the shimmering wall of the hallway.
>>>>>>[!success]
>>>>>>The illusion shatters around you like black glass, the sound echoing only in your mind. For a brief moment, you are back in the main hall of the Great Library, the familiar space a welcome sight. Then, with a deafening slam, the doors to the wellspring room swing shut behind you, and a faint, metallic laugh echoes in your thoughts. Jolted from some kind of trance by the sound, you realise that you are still trapped with the others. However, you feel confident that you might see through any further psychological tricks. *You gain a +5 to all Will Saves until you leave.*

## Books

You notice there are exactly *(four/party count)* books laid out on the tables, each seemingly waiting for a specific reader.

### [[The Archetypes#The Shaman|The Shaman]]'s book

The book on the table is jarringly out of place among the tomes of arcane theory and spellcraft. Its battered leather cover is embossed not with runes, but with the mundane title: _Rules of Engagement: A Realistic Role-Playing Game_.
The pages are dog-eared and stained, as if it has been read and reread by anxious hands. Skimming through its pages, you find the story of a party of *(four)* military sorcerers—uncannily similar to your own group—tasked with investigating a terrorist attack. The bookmarked page describes the party’s entry into an infinite library, its shelves twisting and shifting, trapping them in a maze that feeds on hope and fear. Whether they live or die is left entirely up to chance. Beside the book rest two small icosahedral objects. At first glance, they appear to be dice, but each of their twenty faces is painted with the numeral 1. Meanwhile, the characters in the story cling to hope. They believe in miracles, in mercy, in the benevolence of their god. But there is nothing they can do. For a moment, you feel as if you are being watched by the library itself.

### [[The Archetypes#The Adventurer|The Adventurer]]'s book

The book which draws your attention the most is a biography, seemingly written about a heroic sorcerer who saved thousands of lives and inspired generations. Its cover is adorned with myriad awards and praise from authors and reviewers: front and centre are the words, *"Beautiful... it brought me to tears"* accompanied by five stars.
Opening the book, however, your excitement immediately dissipates. The pages are blank. You rifle through tens of pages at once, but not one of them contains a single word. It is a story without a hero, a legend without a legacy. As you stare at the empty pages, a profound sense of pointlessness washes over you. All that potential, all that glory... unwritten, unremembered, as if it never existed at all. Your thoughts have been sapped away by the devastating emptiness of the book.

### [[The Archetypes#The Detective|The Detective]]'s book

You never liked poring over tomes during your time at the Academy, so you are delighted when you notice that the book lying open on the table besides you is something a little more your speed. A hard-boiled noir detective mystery: now this is a *real* book. Although, there is definitely something off about it. For starters, it's extremely thin - it looks maybe about a hundred pages long... but that can't be right, surely?
You begin to read. The prose is sharp, the mystery compelling. A dame, a murder, a city full of secrets. But as you read on, the clues begin to contradict each other. Witnesses lie for no reason. Leads that seemed promising dissolve into dead ends. The detective, once determined, grows weary. The narrative starts to fray, his inner monologue turning from sharp deduction to rambling despair. Halfway through, he stops investigating entirely. The last few pages are short, fragmented sentences describing the bottom of a whiskey bottle, the burn of cheap liquor, the crushing weight of a case that was never meant to be solved. The final page contains a single, typewritten sentence: *"The real mystery was why he ever thought it mattered."* The book slams shut on its own, and the air around you suddenly smells of stale smoke and regret.

### [[The Archetypes#The Chemist|The Chemist]]'s book

The book before you is a clinical, professional-looking research journal titled _On the Quantum Entanglement and Metaphysical Resistance of Abyssal Catalyst_.
You eagerly flip it open. The first few chapters detail nearly fifty years of rigorous, painstaking research into curing Abyssal Corruption. The methods are sound, the experiments meticulously documented. But the tone sharply shifts as the author describes a horrifying discovery. Like a quantum particle, the very act of observing the Catalyst — of attempting to analyse its properties — fundamentally changes it. Every test yields a different result. Every formula becomes obsolete the moment it is written. The data is a chaotic, meaningless mess because the subject is actively, malevolently resisting comprehension. The final chapter is no longer a scientific paper, but a desperate warning, concluding that a cure is not just difficult, but metaphysically impossible. As you read the final, hopeless words — *"There will never be a cure"* — a wave of violent nausea washes over you. The air tastes of copper, and you feel as if the toxic, corrupting knowledge from the page is seeping directly into your veins. It can't be true. It mustn't be true.

### The Barbarian's Book

You have no interest in the dusty tomes and arcane drivel that line these shelves. Your language is violence. Rather, it is something else left on one of the tables which catches your eye. It's not a book. It's a thick, heavy, and brutally functional **After-Action Report**, bound in scratched metal. There is no title, only a stencilled case number that instantly sends a jolt of ice through your gut. You recognise it, and with a grim certainty, you wrench it open.

The pages are not paper, but thin sheets of processed data-slate, complete with distant and grainy photographs of the aftermath. It is a clinical, detached autopsy of the day that changed you. The report meticulously details the structural damage to your town, the agonising casualty count. It's all correct, chillingly accurate. But as you reach the final summary, the analysis section, the report's cold conclusion makes the fire in your soul flicker and die. According to this official, meticulously detailed report, the disaster was **not** an enemy attack. Redacted communications logs hint at a catastrophic miscalculation, a cover-up at the highest levels. The very enemy you have spent your life hunting, the single focus of every ounce of your hatred, is listed merely as "not present at the event."

Because the attack you remember, the one that fuelled your vengeance, was an accident. Friendly fire. An attempt by greedy scientists to harness a grotesque kind of magic which never should have existed. This report frames you as the tragic, collateral survivor of a bureaucratic fuck-up. Your all-consuming, world-burning vengeance — the only thing you have left — is re-contextualized as a pointless, misdirected tantrum. The cold from the report spreads up your arms. For the first time in years, the inferno of your rage feels... small. Smothered. And the only thing left in its place is the freezing, empty void of doubt.

## Encounter with the [[Corrupted Chimera]]

As the last book is read, a low, grinding hum fills the impossible space. The light from the central wellspring flickers and dims. A skittering sound echoes from the shadowed ceiling high above — the sound of metallic limbs finding purchase on stone, and the distinct, chilling hum of a cybernetic power core spinning to life. The hunt has begun.
