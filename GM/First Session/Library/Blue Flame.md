The **Blue Flame** burns with a terrifying, ethereal glow. This is not a typical **Draw Point**; it is a raw, screaming nexus of power, far more alive and volatile than any other, thrashing and roaring within an ornate, ancient brazier. Into the cold, heavy silver are etched words that serve as both warning and testament: _**"Vis Absoluta Manet"**_ – _Absolute Force Endures._

To attempt to [[Drawing Spells|Draw]] from this tempestuous wellspring is a gamble with ruin. The flame itself is inherently unstable, a barely contained explosion of concentrated magic, and the spectral **[[Ichor Wraith]]s** are its fierce, unrelenting guardians. Any interaction demands the utmost caution and precise control, for to falter, even for a moment, is to invite catastrophic consequences.

## Player Options

### 1. **Attempt to Draw from the Flame**

The players can attempt to Draw raw magical energy or knowledge from the Blue Flame. This requires a series of skill checks to control the volatile energy. The checks and their outcomes are as follows:

#### **Skill Checks** (against the Flame's AC)

- **[[Stats#✨ Magic|Magic]]:** To understand and manipulate the magical energy.
- **[[Stats#💙 Spirit|Spirit]]** To resist the mental strain of the flame's chaotic power.
- **[[Stats#🛡️Vitality|Vitality]]** To endure the physical toll of interacting with the unstable energy.

#### **Successes**

- **1 Success:** The player gains a small amount of Ichor energy, enough to gain a single [[Drawing Spells#Draw Amount|Draw]] of a single spell that they are already [[Familiarity With Spells|Familiar]] with. However, they feel drained, suffering a temporary penalty to [[Stats#💙 Spirit|Spirit]] (-1 for 1 hour).
- **2 Successes:** The player gains a moderate amount of Ichor energy, enough to power [[Drawing Spells#Draw Amount|Two Draws]], this time from the **Blue Flame Draw List** below. **They are not drained.**
- **3 Successes:** The player gains **three Draws** from the Draw List. Additionally, they stabilise the flame temporarily, preventing it from lashing out (negating all failures, treating them as single basic successes). **They are not drained.**

#### **Blue Flame Draw List (2+ Successes)**

*(When drawing from the Blue Flame, the player immediately **Stocks** the spell. Since they should be out of combat when drawing from the flame, this does not have any effect on the amount of actions required.)*

If the players have not already successfully studied the flame...
You hold your palm at arm's length toward the Blue Flame, closing your eyes. You immediately become overwhelmed by the vast expanse of spells which have been forcibly compressed into the thrashing flame, hundreds at a time leaping out at you in flashes, like a videotape on fast-forward.

While you could reach out into the swirling mass of Ichor and leave it entirely up to chance *(1d8)* what you Draw from it, if you instead wish to sort through the noise and make sense of all this, you will first need to [[Blue Flame#3. **Study the Flame**|study the flame]] closer.

>[!success]- [[Stats#🍀 Luck|Luck]] DC 18
>The player now considers themselves lucky, and has the option to roll 1d8 to choose a random spell. They will gain an **extra draw** where they do the same again.

#### **Failures**

- **1 Failure:** The flame lashes out, dealing **2d6 ❄️ Cold damage** to the player.
- **2 Failures:** The flame explodes outward, dealing **4d6 ❄️ Cold damage** to everyone in the room and summoning 1 [[Ichor Wraith]].
- **3 Failures:** The flame destabilises completely, causing a catastrophic explosion. Everyone in the room takes **6d6 ❄️ Cold damage**, and 2 [[Ichor Wraith]]s are summoned. The flame becomes even more unstable, making future attempts to interact with it more dangerous (all DCs increase by +2).

---

### 2. **Destroy the Flame**

The players can attempt to destroy the Blue Flame outright. This requires a coordinated effort, as the flame is resistant to most forms of damage. The Ichor Wraiths will attack relentlessly to protect it.

**Resistances:**
⚔️ Phys: **Reflect** *(You can't punch a flame, ouch)*
🧪 Chem: **Resist** *(Acid and poison won't do much here, but splashing the flame has a small effect on the Ichor Wraiths within)*
✨ Rad: **Resist** *(This damages the flame, but not as much as you thought it would)*

**Weaknesses:**
💥 Force: **Weak** *(You successfully attempt to blow out the flame with wind-based attacks)*
🌌 Void: **Weak** *(Special interaction, see [[#3. **Study the Flame**]])*

**Immunities:**
🔥 Fire: **Drain** *(The flame absorbs Fire energy, healing for the amount of damage dealt)*
❄️ Cold: **Null** *(The flame and the Ichor Wraiths are composed of the same magical substance)*
🌀 Psy: **Null** *(It doesn't have a mind or soul, therefore is immune to Psychic)*

#### **Successes**

These occur when an attack connects.

- **1 Success:** The flame flickers but remains intact.
- **2 Successes:** The flame is significantly weakened, shrinking to half its former size, its unrelenting burning now slowed and candle-like.
  - No more Ichor Wraiths can spawn from failures when interacting with the flame.
- **3 Successes:** With a final burst of energy, the flame is extinguished. The remaining Ichor Wraiths instantly evaporate.
  - The players must succeed on a **DC 15 [[Saving Throws#Will|Will Save]]** or take **3d6 ❄️ Cold damage**.

#### **Failures**

These occur when an attack does no damage (either from missing, or being drained, nullified or reflected.)

- **1 Failure:** The flame retaliates, dealing **2d6 ❄️ Cold damage** to the attacker.
- **2 Failures:** The flame surges with power, summoning 1 [[Ichor Wraith]] and dealing **2d6 ❄️ Cold damage** once again.
- **3 Failures:** The flame becomes unstable, causing a partial explosion. Everyone in the room takes **4d6 ❄️ Cold damage**, and 2 [[Ichor Wraith]]s are summoned.

---

### 3. **Study the Flame**

Players will make a [[Stats#🧠 Wisdom|Wisdom]] check against DC 15.
#### **Successes**

- **1 Success:** The players learn that the flame is responsible for the "leaking" of Ichor onto its surroundings, and that destroying it will probably defeat the remaining [[Ichor Wraith]]s. The **Draw List** is unlocked, although the players will not immediately become familiar with any of the spells.
- **2 Successes:** The players discover that the flame is vulnerable to [[Elements#💥 Force|💥 Force]]. The player studying the flame will become Familiar with a random spell from the Draw List: 
	- As hundreds of spells shoot past in your mind, you quickly catch a glimpse of what you're sure is the rune for *(Random spell)*. You happen to already be Familiar with this spell from your time studying magic, and you share your knowledge with the party.
- **3 Successes:** The players uncover a method to stabilise the flame temporarily, making it safer to Draw from or destroy **(all DCs reduced by -2 for the next attempt).**
	- You are fairly certain that by negating a portion of the Flame's power with [[Elements#🌌 Void|🌌 Void]] damage, you could make any further interactions significantly less dangerous. *(Applying Void damage once reduces interaction DCs by 2).*

#### **Failures**

- **1 Failure:** The flame flares up, dealing **1d6 ❄️ Cold damage** to the closest player.
- **2 Failures:** The flame destabilises, increasing the DCs of all future interactions by +2.
- **3 Failures:** This has the same effect as 2 failures, while summoning an [[Ichor Wraith]].

> [!success] Once the players have destroyed the Blue Flame, move to the [[Aftermath]] scene.
