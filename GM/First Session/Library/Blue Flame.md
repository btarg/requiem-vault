The **Blue Flame** is a **Draw Point**, a rare and powerful Source of Ichor. You may attempt to [[Drawing Spells|Draw]] from it, but doing so comes with significant risks. The flame is unstable, and the **[[Ichor Wraith]]s** are fiercely protective of it. Interacting with the Blue Flame requires careful consideration, as failure will almost certainly lead to catastrophic consequences.

## Player Options

### 1. **Attempt to Draw from the Flame**

The players can attempt to Draw raw magical energy or knowledge from the Blue Flame. This requires a series of skill checks to control the volatile energy. The checks and their outcomes are as follows:

#### **Skill Checks**

- **Arcana (Intelligence):** To understand and manipulate the magical energy.
- **Willpower (Wisdom):** To resist the mental strain of the flame's chaotic power.
- **Constitution:** To endure the physical toll of interacting with the unstable energy.

#### **Successes**

- **1 Success:** The player gains a small amount of Ichor energy, enough to gain a single [[Drawing Spells#Draw Amount|Draw]] of a single spell that they are already [[Familiarity With Spells|Familiar]] with. However, they feel drained, suffering a temporary penalty to [[Stats#💙 Spirit]] (-1 for 1 hour).
- **2 Successes:** The player gains a moderate amount of Ichor energy, enough to power [[Drawing Spells#Draw Amount|Two Draws]] of any Familiar spell.
- **3 Successes:** The player gains Three Draws, this time from the **Blue Flame Draw List** below. Additionally, they stabilise the flame temporarily, preventing it from lashing out (negating all failures, treating them as single basic successes).

#### **Blue Flame Draw List (3 Successes)**

*Choose one spell from this list per Draw gained (total of three Draws):*

1. **[[Cone of Cold]] (Level 5):** Unleash a devastating cone of freezing energy.
    - **Element:** ❄️ Cold
2. **[[Phantasmal Killer]] (Level 4):** Manifest a creature of nightmare in the target's mind, potentially frightening them to death.
    - **Element:** 🌀 Psychic
3. **[[Resilient Sphere]] (Level 4):** Create an immobile sphere of shimmering force around a creature or object, protecting it or trapping it.
    - **Element:** 💥 Force
4. **[[Shadow Blast]] (Level 4):** Hurl a projectile of solidified shadow that damages and potentially drains strength.
    - **Element:** 🌌 Void
5. **[[Haste]] (Level 3):** Infuse a target with incredible speed, granting extra actions and bonuses.
    - **Element:** 💥 Force
6. **[[Dispel Magic]] (Level 3):** Attempt to counteract a magical effect, potentially ending it prematurely.
    - **Element:** 🌌 Void

#### **Failures**

- **1 Failure:** The flame lashes out, dealing **2d6 ❄️ Cold damage** to the player and summoning 1 [[Ichor Wraith]].
- **2 Failures:** The flame explodes outward, dealing **4d6 ❄️ Cold damage** to everyone in the room and summoning 2 [[Ichor Wraith]]s.
- **3 Failures:** The flame destabilises completely, causing a catastrophic explosion. Everyone in the room takes **6d6 ❄️ Cold damage**, and 3 [[Ichor Wraith]]s are summoned. The flame becomes even more unstable, making future attempts to interact with it more dangerous (all DCs increase by +2).

---

### 2. **Destroy the Flame**

The players can attempt to destroy the Blue Flame outright. This requires a coordinated effort, as the flame is resistant to most forms of damage. The Ichor Wraiths will attack relentlessly to protect it.

#### Stats

HP: 35

**Resistances:**
⚔️ Phys: Reflect *(You can't punch a flame, ouch)*
🧪 Chem: Resist *(Acid and poison won't do much here, but splashing the flame has a small effect on the Ichor Wraiths within)*
🌀 Psy: Null *(It doesn't have a mind or soul, therefore is immune to Psychic)*
✨ Vit: Resist *(This damages the flame, but not as much as you thought it would)*

**Weaknesses:**
💥 Force: Weak *(You successfully attempt to blow out the flame with wind-based attacks)*
🌌 Void: Weak *(Special interaction, see [[#3. **Study the Flame**]])*

**Immunities/Drain:**
🔥 Fire *(The flame absorbs Fire energy, healing for the amount of damage dealt)*
❄️ Cold *(The flame and the Ichor Wraiths are composed of the same magical substance)*
#### **Successes**

- **1 Success:** The flame flickers but remains intact.
- **2 Successes:** The flame is significantly weakened, shrinking to half its former size, its unrelenting burning now slowed and candle-like.
  - No more Ichor Wraiths can spawn from failures when interacting with the flame.
- **3 Successes:** With a final burst of energy, the flame is destroyed. The remaining Ichor Wraiths instantly evaporate.
  - The players must succeed on a **DC 15 [[Saving Throws#Will|Will Save]]** or take **3d6 ❄️ Cold damage**.

#### **Failures**

- **1 Failure:** The flame retaliates, dealing **2d6 ❄️ Cold damage** to the attacker.
- **2 Failures:** The flame surges with power, summoning 1 [[Ichor Wraith]] and dealing **2d6 ❄️ Cold damage** once again.
- **3 Failures:** The flame becomes unstable, causing a partial explosion. Everyone in the room takes **4d6 ❄️ Cold damage**, and 2 [[Ichor Wraith]]s are summoned.

---

### 3. **Study the Flame**

The players can take time to study the Blue Flame, learning more about its nature and the risks of interacting with it. This requires a series of skill checks to gather information.

#### **Skill Checks**

- **Arcana (Intelligence):** To analyse the magical properties of the flame.
- **Investigation (Intelligence):** To examine the surrounding area for clues about the flame's origin.
- **History (Intelligence):** To recall any relevant lore about similar phenomena.

#### **Successes**

- **1 Success:** The players learn that the flame is responsible for the "leaking" of Ichor onto its surroundings, and that destroying it will probably defeat the remaining [[Ichor Wraith]]s.
- **2 Successes:** The players discover that the flame is vulnerable to [[Elements#💥 Force|💥 Force]].
- **3 Successes:** The players uncover a method to stabilise the flame temporarily, making it safer to Draw from or destroy **(all DCs reduced by -2 for the next attempt).**
  - You are fairly certain that by negating a portion of the Flame's power with [[Elements#🌌 Void|🌌 Void]] damage, you could make any further interactions significantly less dangerous. *(Applying Void damage once reduces interaction DCs by 2).*

#### **Failures**

- **1 Failure:** The flame flares up, dealing **1d6 ❄️ Cold damage** to the closest player.
- **2 Failures:** The flame destabilises, increasing the DCs of all future interactions by +2.
- **3 Failures:** This has the same effect as 2 failures, while summoning an [[Ichor Wraith]].

> [!success] Once the players have destroyed the Blue Flame, move to the [[Aftermath]] scene.
