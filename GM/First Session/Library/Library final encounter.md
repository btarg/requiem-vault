### Breaking through

Just as you destroy the magical seal cast on the door, a low, guttural snarl echoes from the far end of the entrance hall, from behind one of the many bookshelves. The sound is followed by the scrape of claws on stone, much closer now. Then another growl, closer still, filled with an unnatural aggression. Pure hate. Hunger.

The hairs on the back of your neck stand up. You are not alone, and it knows you are here. Running into the open field in the dead of night would put you at a disadvantage. There is no choice but to stand your ground.
