>[!tip] Back at the [[First session start#Entering the Library|Library Entrance]]...
>As the last of the [[Ichor Wraith]]s dissipate into nothing more than fading motes of cold blue light, a tense quiet falls over the grand entrance hall of the Library. The frantic energy of the battle subsides, leaving behind the eerie stillness of the abandoned space.

The air remains unnaturally cold, a lingering chill left by the defeated Wraiths. The candles, miraculously undisturbed by the arcane struggle, continue to burn low, casting long, flickering shadows across the dusty tables. The books strewn across them still emanate a faint, residual blue mist, the last vestiges of the Ichor the Wraiths were feeding upon.

Looking closer at the environment, you notice a subtle - yet disturbing - damage, one that goes beyond the simple decay of time.

**What You Can Observe:**

>[!question]- **Examine where the flame once burned**
>Inspecting the large silver brazier in which the Blue Flame once burned, you notice a small pool of a thick, still liquid.
>
>>[!success]- Perception check DC 10
>>It is a darker blue than the flame. The sides of the brazier are streaked with the same liquid, leading you to believe there was once much more of it. Someone was *feeding* the flame.
>

>[!question]- **Inspect the disturbed books**
>The books the Wraiths were feeding on show signs of accelerated decay where the blue mist lingers. More disturbingly, some pages seem warped, the ink running in unnatural patterns, almost like veins. On a few bindings, you spot a faint, oily, iridescent sheen – a tell-tale sign of **Abyssal Catalyst** contamination, albeit faint and old. It seems the Wraiths were drawn not just to the Ichor, but perhaps to the Catalyst's corrupting influence as well.

>[!question]- **Observe the architecture/decay**
>While much of the decay is normal for an abandoned building, certain areas show unusual warping. Stone pillars seem subtly twisted, metal fixtures are corroded in bizarre, almost organic patterns, and patches of dust on the floor seem to clump together unnaturally, occasionally twitching as if alive. These are hallmarks of long-term, low-level exposure to the **Abyssal Catalyst**. This place isn't just saturated with Ichor; it's fundamentally tainted.

### The sealed door

Even with your enemies defeated, it is not safe to remain here for much longer. You begin moving to the door, attempting to call in your success on your way out.

(Random player), you pull out your phone from your jacket to call for an evac team. The moment the screen flickers to life, thin tendrils of acrid smoke begin to curl from its seams. It grows unnaturally hot in your hand within seconds, clattering onto the dusty stone floor, increasingly thick smoke pouring out of it, before sputtering out. The air around you shimmers faintly for a moment. The rest of you also quickly abandon your electronics.

The sheer concentration of Ichor and residual Catalyst contamination in the area is far higher than anticipated. Using complex technology is hazardous within these walls. It will be hours until anyone outside becomes concerned enough to evacuate you from the Library. You're cut off.

Reaching the massive, ornate steel-and-glass doors through which you entered, you find your exit barred. Before, there was only solid, heavy wood - but now, intricately carved runes crawl across the door's surface like bloody veins, weaving through shattered glass, pulsing with a red glow. A low, resonant hum emanates from them, and the air before the doors feels thick and resistant.


**Interacting with the Door (Before or During Combat):**

The warded door has 25 HP.
It has no weakness, but is immune to PSY, ELEC, COLD and CHEM.


>[!question]- **Decipher the Ward ([[Stats#🧠 Wisdom|Wisdom]] DC 18 )**
>You focus your arcane knowledge on the pulsing runes.
>**Success:** You identify the ward as Abjuration magic, powered directly by the ambient Ichor. You determine it's particularly vulnerable to [[Elements#💥 Force|💥 Force]] damage or effects that specifically counteract magic (like [[Dispel Magic]]). You also spot a primary focusing rune near the centre that seems key to its integrity.
>**Failure:** The patterns are too complex or alien; you learn nothing useful.
>**Critical Failure:** Arcane feedback shocks you for 1d4 [[Elements#🌀 Psychic|Psychic]] damage.

>[!question]- **Target a Weak Point ([[Stats#👁️ Perception|Perception]] DC 16)**
>You scan the door and runes for physical flaws or inconsistencies in the ward's application.
>**Success:** You notice that one of the runes seems hastily etched. Attacking this specific spot physically might weaken the ward significantly. **(Gain +1 to all future checks against the door)**
>**Failure:** The warding seems uniformly applied; no obvious weak points are visible.

>[!question]- **Overload with Magic (Spell Attack vs. AC 15)**
>You hurl magical energy directly at the ward, attempting to disrupt it.
>**Hit/Effect:** The runes flare violently, cracks appearing in the ward's light. If using a spell like [[Dispel Magic]], make a counteract check against DC 20. Damage dealt on a success is based on the spell you use. Dispel Magic will instantly half the HP of the door.
>**Miss/No Effect:** Your magic harmlessly dissipates against the ward.

>[!question]- **Breach with Force (Strength DC 20)**
>You attempt to physically slash through the veins which hold the door shut.
>
>**Success:** A loud screech echoes as the metal warps with the impact, the ward flickering violently, momentarily weakening. Roll damage based on what you're using to break through.
>**Failure:** Your effort rebounds harmlessly. Magical energy surges outwards like lightning. Roll a [[Saving Throws#Reflex|Reflex saving throw]] against DC 8, where on any failure you are knocked back 10ft and take 1d4 of [[Elements#⚡ Electricity (ELEC)|Elec]] damage.
>**Critical Failure:** The same as a regular failure, but you strain yourself, taking an extra 1d4 [[Elements#⚔️ Physical (PHYS)|Phys]] damage from the rebound.
>
