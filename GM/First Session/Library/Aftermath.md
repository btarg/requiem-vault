>[!tip] [[First session start#Entering the Library|Library Entrance]]
>With the last of the initial swarm of [[Ichor Wraith]]s dissipated into nothing more than fading motes of cold blue light, a tense quiet falls over the grand entrance hall of the Library. The frantic energy of the battle subsides, leaving behind the eerie stillness of the abandoned space.

The air remains unnaturally cold, a lingering chill left by the defeated Wraiths. The candles, miraculously undisturbed by the arcane struggle, continue to burn low, casting long, flickering shadows across the dusty floor and towering bookshelves. The books strewn across the tables still emanate a faint, residual blue mist, the last vestiges of the Ichor the Wraiths were feeding upon.

Looking closer at the environment, you notice subtle but disturbing signs that go beyond simple decay or Ichor leakage.

**What You Can Observe:**

>[!question]- **Examine the defeated Wraiths' remains**
>Where the Wraiths dissolved, there's no physical residue, only a lingering, bone-deep cold spot that fades slowly. The air itself seems thin and brittle in these locations.

>[!question]- **Inspect the disturbed books**
>The books the Wraiths were feeding on show signs of accelerated decay where the blue mist lingers. More disturbingly, some pages seem warped, the ink running in unnatural patterns, almost like veins. On a few bindings, you spot a faint, oily, iridescent sheen â€“ a tell-tale sign of **Abyssal Catalyst** contamination, albeit faint and old. It seems the Wraiths were drawn not just to the Ichor, but perhaps to the Catalyst's corrupting influence as well.

>[!question]- **Observe the architecture/decay**
>While much of the decay is normal for an abandoned building, certain areas show unusual warping. Stone pillars seem subtly twisted, metal fixtures are corroded in bizarre, almost organic patterns, and patches of dust on the floor seem to clump together unnaturally, occasionally twitching as if alive. These are hallmarks of long-term, low-level exposure to the **Abyssal Catalyst**. This place isn't just saturated with Ichor; it's fundamentally tainted.
