## Outside the Library
The Great Library stands as a breathtakingly imposing Art Nouveau bastion, once a proud symbol of the nation's conquest over magical knowledge. Now, it lies in decay, its grandeur consumed by creeping overgrowth and weathered stone. As far as you know, nobody has been here in a very long time.

Near-blindly treading through mud and bracken, you push through layers of barbed wire-topped fences, each adorned with screaming black-and-yellow signs, their rusted metal warped and twisted. You grasp the hilts of your blades as you approach the entrance, already tasting the Ichor in the air. Through the beautiful stained-glass windows, rapid flashes of blue outshine your flashlights for brief, intermittent moments, like the strobe of a police car.

### Actions for the players:

>[!warning]- **Look closer at the signs**
>Looking closer at the signs surrounding the Library, you see that a majority of them warn of rabid animals, with vicious-looking depictions of wolves printed on several blood-red metal plates. There are also a few triangular signs with trefoils and biohazard symbols. The words "RISK OF DEATH" are written in at least ten languages on another.

>[!note]- **Study the lights**
>You notice that the strobing lights inside the library appear to be moving. Not like a light show at a club or concert; it looks more like many glowing objects are darting back and forth inside. The flashing seems to become more erratic the closer you are to the Library's entrance. 

## Entering the Library

Upon stepping into the building, you are immediately surrounded by bright blue, flame-like creatures. They swirl overhead in graceful arcs, wispy and gaseous, flickering like living embers. Lighting the dark room with their eerie neon glow, they dive toward dusty, leather-bound tomes, phasing through the pages. Then, leaving an icy breeze in their wake, they dart toward a dancing blue flame at the end of the room.

The candles are unusually lit. Someone has been here before.

### Actions for the players:

>[!question]- **Investigate candles**
>The library's candles have somewhat recently been re-lit, presumably by intrepid urban explorers who have no regard for their own safety. The drifting breaths of the hyperactive creatures flying above you have not managed to extinguish a single flame; most of the candles have burned near to their wicks.

>[!question]- **Look at the books**
>Strewn across the tables in front of you are several open books. They seem to be emanating a pale mist which sparkles with the same vivid blue colour as the wisps.

>[!question]- **Observe the wisps**
>You watch cautiously as the wisps absorb the raw Ichor contained within the words of long-dead mages. The wisps' translucent forms pulsate with newfound energy, shimmering and thrumming, alive with stolen power. They are *feeding.*

>[!question]- **Recall knowledge about the wisps**
>You have read about these creatures before. **Ichor Wraiths** are the arcane world's corpse-flies. They feed on the magic which begins to seep from mages' books and Draw Points as they begin to degrade. They are not as frail as they look.

>[!tip]- **(when close enough) Investigate the blue flame**
>At the far end of the long room, a large, spiralling blue flame flickers and twists. As you draw closer, you realize the wisp-like creatures are converging here, forming a cyclone of Ichor that sweeps up and then scatters torn pages. Despite its fiery appearance, the air around the flame is cold. Touching it is sure to threaten them. You should probably back away slowly.
>>[!question]- If the players know enough about the Wraiths...
>>Before you move away, however, you notice something else. More Ichor Wraiths glide into the blue flame, beginning to coalesce into one writhing mass. They are anticipating danger, and bolstering their strength significantly in response. The room feels much, much colder.

The air suddenly feels a lot less still. Their **(GM Note: call them Ichor Wraiths if the players know this)** frantic movements have inexplicably begun to slow, shifting into something more deliberate, more calculating, like a wary animal sizing up a potential threat. The circling overhead has taken on a new meaning. You are their prey.

***ROLL INITIATIVE***

>[!tip] After defeating the Wraiths, the players move to [[Blue Flame]]
