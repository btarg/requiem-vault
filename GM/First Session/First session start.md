## Outside the Library

The Great Library stands as a breathtakingly imposing Art Nouveau bastion, once a proud symbol of the nation's conquest over magical knowledge. Now, it lies in decay, its grandeur consumed by creeping overgrowth and weathered stone. As far as you know, nobody has been here in a very long time.

### Preparing to enter

Before you begin to walk toward the Library, you take a moment to prepare. You move to the back of your armoured truck, where a Draw Point has been set up for you.
The Draw Point is a pulsing, breathing orb of energy locked behind thick reinforced glass, which occasionally reaches out an arcing tendril of electricity as you hover your hand close to it. A sophisticated network of tubes extracts Ichor from the air to feed the artificial wellspring.

The draw list is as follows:
*(Players should be given the option to roll 1d4 to pick a random one from the list)*

1. [[Force Barrage]] **(Level 1):** manifest and fire shards of solidified magical force toward your enemies, striking with unerring accuracy.
	- **Element:** 💥 Force
	- **Actions:**  `pf2:1` to `pf2:3`
2. [[Thunderstrike]] **(Level 1):** A crackling tendril of lightning accompanied by a deafening clap of thunder, shocking and concussing your target.
	- Element: ⚡Electricity
	- **Actions:** `pf2:2`
3. [[Blazing Bolt]] **(Level 2):** A searing ray of fire.
    - **Element:** 🔥Fire
    - **Actions:**  `pf2:1` to `pf2:3`
4. [[Holy Light]] **(Level 3):** A blazing ray of intense light, infused with holy power.
	- **Element:** ✨Radiant
	- **Actions:** `pf2:2`

### Approaching the Library

The air is sombre. This is it. Once you have taken your blades, the truck driver pulls the door shut with a nod and a whisper of, "Good luck".

You push near-blindly through layers of barbed wire-topped fences, each adorned with screaming black-and-yellow signs, rusted metal warped and twisted. You grasp the hilts of your blades as you approach the entrance, already tasting the Ichor in the air. Through the beautiful stained-glass windows, rapid flashes of blue outshine your flashlights for brief, intermittent moments, like the strobe of a police car.

### Actions for the players:

>[!warning]- **Look closer at the signs**
>Looking closer at the signs surrounding the Library, you see that a majority of them warn of rabid animals, with vicious-looking depictions of wolves printed on several blood-red metal plates. There are also a few triangular signs with trefoils and biohazard symbols. The words "RISK OF DEATH" are written in at least ten languages on another.

>[!note]- **Study the lights**
>You notice that the strobing lights inside the library appear to be moving. Not like a light show at a club or concert; it looks more like many glowing objects are darting back and forth inside. The flashing seems to become more erratic the closer you are to the Library's entrance. 

>[!question]- Examine the entrance
>The towering, ornate doors have been boarded up. The flimsy planks hastily bolted to door's the warped steel are beginning to rot; entering through here will be trivial.

## Entering the Library

Upon stepping into the building, you are immediately surrounded by bright blue, flame-like creatures. They swirl overhead in graceful arcs, wispy and gaseous, flickering like living embers. Lighting the dark room with their eerie neon glow, they dive toward dusty, leather-bound tomes, phasing through the pages. Then, leaving an icy breeze in their wake, they dart toward a dancing blue flame at the end of the room.

The candles are unusually lit. Someone has been here recently.

### Actions for the players:

>[!question]- **Investigate candles**
>The library's candles have somewhat recently been re-lit, presumably by intrepid urban explorers who have no regard for their own safety.
>**Roll a perception check against DC 8.**
>>[!success]- Perception success
>>The drifting breaths of the hyperactive creatures flying above you have not managed to extinguish a single flame; most of the candles have burned near to their wicks. They appear to be *avoiding* the candles.

>[!question]- **Look at the books**
>Strewn across the tables in front of you are several open books. They seem to be emanating a pale mist which sparkles with the same vivid blue colour as the wisps.

>[!question]- **Observe the wisps**
>You watch cautiously as the wisps absorb the raw Ichor contained within the words of long-dead mages. The wisps' translucent forms pulsate with newfound energy, shimmering and thrumming, alive with stolen power. They are *feeding.*

>[!question]- **Recall knowledge about the wisps** ([[Stats#🧠 Wisdom|WIS]] DC 8)
>You have read about these creatures before. **Ichor Wraiths** are the arcane world's corpse-flies. They feed on the magic which begins to seep from mages' books and Draw Points as they begin to degrade. They are not as frail as they look.

### Moving up

All players roll a [[Stats#👁️ Perception|Perception]] check. If two or more roll higher than **DC 10** then it succeeds.

>[!success] You are stopped in your tracks by a low, guttural growl. It seems to be coming from a room up ahead and to the left. *(Players can choose to go to the [[Second Library Room]] to investigate)*

>[!failure] Was that your stomach growling? You haven't eaten for a few hours. You must refocus and press on.

>[!tip]- **(when close enough) Investigate the blue flame**
>At the far end of the long room, a large, spiralling blue flame flickers and twists. As you draw closer, you realize the wisp-like creatures are converging here, forming a cyclone of Ichor that sweeps up and then scatters torn pages. Despite its fiery appearance, the flame exudes a chilling breeze. Moving to close to it is sure to be perceived as a threat.
>>[!question]- If the players know enough about the Wraiths...
>>Before you move away, however, you notice something else. More Ichor Wraiths glide into the blue flame, beginning to coalesce into one writhing mass. They are anticipating danger, and bolstering their strength significantly in response. The room feels much, much colder.

### The players pursue the flame

The air suddenly feels a lot less still. Their **(GM Note: call them Ichor Wraiths if the players know this)** frantic movements have inexplicably begun to slow, shifting into something more deliberate, more calculating, like a wary animal sizing up a potential threat. The circling overhead has taken on a new meaning. You are their prey.

***ROLL INITIATIVE***

*The players will be greeted with **five** [[Ichor Wraith]]s. If the players stick to the candles, they will not be attacked directly by Ichor Wraiths, forcing them to instead use spells.*

>[!tip] After defeating the Wraiths, the players move to [[Blue Flame]]
