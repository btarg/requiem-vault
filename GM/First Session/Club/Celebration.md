In the wake of the [[Blue Flame]]'s destruction, you have been invited to the unofficial celebration by the Captain and their fellow mercs, who are eager to toast your success. The atmosphere is electric, and for a moment, it seems like they can finally relax. The celebratory party is being held at a popular underground club, a vibrant and chaotic space packed with people.

### Outside

(Random Player), Before you can enter, you are stopped by a security guard at the front door, who gestures towards your hilt. It is customary to leave weapons out of neutral zones like these. You've seen others before manage to sneak in concealed arms "just in case" - but the bouncer's stern expression makes it clear to you that the fight might be best kept outside.

>[!tip] Let the players be creative with this: can they do some illusion silliness to bring a concealed weapon in, or make some kind of excuse with Deception?

### Entering the club

Neon lights pulse in time with live music, casting the room in shifting hues of red, blue, and green. You are greeted by your comrades from the Military Academy, who cheer and raise their glasses in your honour as you pass.

However, only a few minutes into your night of celebration, something begins to feel off. The professor was supposed to meet you here, yet she is nowhere to be found, and attempts to contact her go unanswered. Your mission is far from over, and you have plenty to discuss. It's also extremely uncharacteristic of her to be late.

### Actions for the players:

>[!question]- **Ask around about the professor**
>You bounce between a few small crowds, showing each a picture of the professor on your phone. Your comrades yield little information. Most shrug and say they haven’t seen her. You hear a wave of laughter coming from a large crowd of very well-dressed, high society types. Despite their numbers, the group seems pretty tight-knit and is visibly walled off from the rest of the crowd. It would certainly take someone with a lot of [[Stats#🗣️ Influence|Influence]] to speak to them.
>>[!success]- DC 10 Influence check succeeds
>>A posh-sounding, flamboyant man takes his arm from around a blonde woman's shoulder, turns to you and raises his glass with a cheer. Your party have managed to quickly garner a reputation - after all, the Library had been the subject of everyone's nightmares for years now, him included.
>>"Have I seen the Professor? Of course, she was here about twenty minutes ago. She did seem a bit spooked by something, I must say; she left in quite a hurry. Perhaps it was those dodgy-looking chaps over there."
>>He points toward a group of suspicious mercenaries.

>[!question]- **Notice the suspicious mercenaries**
>At the edge of the club, a group of mercenaries catches your attention. They look familiar, but something about them seems off. Their movements are stiff, and their faces seem unnaturally blank, as though they’re wearing masks. Their unsettling aura has clearly been noticed, as the crowd has thinned around them.
>>[!question]- **Ask them about the professor:**
>> On closer inspection, they look uncannily similar to a group you know...
>> (Here, describe the player characters. E.g. One of the mercs has X coloured hair, is X feet tall...)
>> The false doppelganger of *(The Player Who Chose To Speak)* grimaces with burning anger at the sight of the professor's picture. **"Yeah, we're looking for her too. That bitch set us up for failure. When I find her, I'll kill her myself."**

### Fight, Fight, Fight

The air shimmers around the mercs, as if they have been transposed onto reality itself via green-screen. There is something deeply wrong about them, something threatening which triggers your fight-or-flight.
One of them raises his tone condescendingly, addressing (Random Player), with a shooing gesture "Go on, fuck off then."

>[!success]- DC 10 [[Stats#🧠 Wisdom|Wisdom]] check
>Staring back at him, you feel as though you are looking into a mirror. You've seen this trick before. Each one of them is using an [[Illusory Disguise]], attempting to look more like you. The cracks in the illusion are beginning to show.
>>[!question]- DC 15 [[Stats#👁️ Perception|Perception]] check
>>You are able to see right through their cheap party tricks. You notice bubble-like distortions in the shape of holstered blades, around each of their waists. They have been concealing weapons, clearly looking for a fight. Judging by their agitated expressions and use of disguise, it appears that they were planning to jump you.

### Outcome:

>[!success]- **If the players defeat the mercenaries**
>The mercenaries are knocked out or forced to flee, leaving behind cryptic remarks about their bitterness and plans. Shortly after the fight ends, the professor arrives, explaining that she was delayed by an urgent matter. She thanks you for handling the situation and warns you that the mercenaries may be part of a larger conspiracy.

>[!failure]- **If the players are defeated**
>The mercenaries escape, leaving you injured and humiliated. The professor arrives too late to intervene but helps you recover and vows to investigate the mercenaries’ motives. The encounter leaves you shaken, and the celebratory mood is completely shattered.
