Instead of using the [[Critical Hits and Knockdowns#One More!|Extra Action]] gained from a [[Critical Hits and Knockdowns|Critical Hit]] yourself, you can pass it to any party member, regardless of position, as long as they are:
- Able to take actions (i.e. not **Dead** or **Dying**)
- Fighting in the same combat encounter (i.e. not in another dungeon)

Passing the Baton moves *you* to the bottom of the current turn order, and the receiving ally to the top. The ally receives exactly **one [[Actions|Action]]**, but not a full turn.

## Chaining

Allies who have already been passed to cannot be passed to again in the same chain! With a 4-player party, you will only be able to Baton Pass up to 4 times.

## Baton Pass Bonus

Each time the Baton is passed, a cumulative +1 bonus is added to the
attack/spell rolls of the player currently holding the Baton.

* **Max Bonus:** Equals the number of players in the party (e.g., +4 for a
    4-player party).
* **Reset:** If the chain is broken (e.g., the player with the Baton doesn't
    score a [[Critical Hits and Knockdowns#Triggering a Critical Hit|Crit]] or chooses not to pass), the bonus resets to +0.

## Helping Downed Allies

If an ally is [[Critical Hits and Knockdowns#Knockdown (Prone/Downed) Status|Downed]] and you are close enough to Help them (typically adjacent), passing the Baton to them allows them to stand up *and* take their one Action. This does not apply if the ally is **Dying** or **Dead**.

> [!tip] Make sure everyone gets their turn!
