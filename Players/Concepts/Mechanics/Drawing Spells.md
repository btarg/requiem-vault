Acquiring spells involves *Drawing* them from enemies.

* **Range:** You must be within attack range of the enemy.
* **Knowledge:** To know what spells an enemy has available to Draw, you must either have prior knowledge or spend [[Actions]] to [[Familiarity with Spells#Identifying and Misidentifying Spells|Identify]] them. GMs generally don't reveal Draw Lists freely.
* **On Kill:** Killing an enemy grants a free Draw of a random spell from that enemy.
* **Draw Action (1 Action):**
  * **Option 1: Cast (0 additional Actions):** Immediately attempt to Cast the drawn spell without adding it to inventory. Requires having enough remaining Actions for the spell's casting cost. The GM should inform you of the Action cost beforehand.
  * **Option 2: Stock (2 additional Actions):** Add multiple copies of the drawn spell to your inventory. This costs a total of 3 Actions (1 to Draw + 2 to Stock). See [[#Draw Amount]].
  * **Option 3: Relinquish (0 additional Actions):** Do nothing with the spell, returning it to the target. Useful if you can't Cast it (not enough Actions) and don't want to Stock it.

## Draw Amount

When you choose to **Stock** (Option 2 above):

* Roll \(1d4\) to determine the number of spell copies gained.
* If you have [[Elemental Affinities#Mastery|Mastery]] over the spell's element, roll \(2d4\) instead.
* Add your [[Stats#Luck|Luck]] stat as a flat bonus to the roll result.
  * Example (3 Luck, no Mastery): Roll \(1d4 + 3\).
  * Example (3 Luck, with Mastery): Roll \(2d4 + 3\).
* The maximum flat bonus from Luck added to the roll is **4**.
