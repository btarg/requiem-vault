## The Barbarian

Your blood boils. Hate, *hate* in its purest form, writhing throughout your body. You have no motive but to tear every damned creature tainted by that hellish blue rot asunder. Though, that wasn't always the case. You had a real reason, one born of nuanced thought and understanding, to join the Academy. You may have lost your way, but you're still here. Lurking somewhere in the darkened corners of a brain teeming with spiteful thoughts, trying to remember. Letting your body act on its own, out of the carnal pleasure it takes in killing. Accept the truth already: you revel in death.

## The Shaman

The only thing you ever do out of your own free will is pray. You once prayed that the people may be cleansed of the Corruption, that the terrorists may find God, that the city may be saved. There was no answer, so you joined the Academy. Now, though you commune with the Spirits daily, it is your Will which has placed you outside The Great Library; that twisted, festering symbol of perdition. You fear it, more than anything. God is not here. This will be your ultimate test.

## The Chemist

The discovery of the Abyssal Catalyst has dramatically altered the scientific landscape. The way in which its energy warps the living is almost *beautiful.* That's what you tell yourself, anyway. Your flesh is delicate, paper-thin and flaking away — yet a permanent, excruciating itch forces your hand. You claw yourself apart, a racking cough drawing blood from your fragile throat, gasping for breath as your lungs collapse again. It *fascinates* you. Perhaps, at ground zero, you might learn enough about this affliction to buy yourself some more time. There is no better way of studying the Corruption than by being your own Guinea pig. You will be the one to spur the greatest scientific revolution since humans discovered how to control Ichor. Everyone else is but a means to an end.

## The Detective

You have spent years chasing shadows, piecing together fragments of a puzzle that no one else seems to care about. The Corruption took someone from you — someone you loved more than life itself. Their face is a blur now, but the ache remains sharp. The Academy promised answers, but all you’ve found are lies and half-truths buried beneath layers of bureaucracy. Still, you persist. You *need* to. The void calls to you, and you answer, knowing it may be the only thing that can lead you to the truth.

## The Adventurer

Years of training led up to this moment. You're finally here, the hero of the story. Everyone will know your name; people will speak it with a sparkle in their eyes, as if recounting tales of old — you are the new folklore. You have worked hard for this position, climbing the ranks, trampling underfoot every sorcerer you deemed lesser than yourself. Such is the way of the world: only the strongest will survive. You're still daydreaming of blinding spotlight when you arrive at The Great Library. You'll show them. *You,* and you alone, are the protagonist.
