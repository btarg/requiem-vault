For years, society has been reeling from a series of devastating terrorist attacks. The weapon of choice: dirty bombs laced with a volatile substance known as **Abyssal Catalyst**. This horrific chemical doesn't just melt through flesh on contact; it warps life, twisting ordinary animals like dogs, cats, and birds into savage, magically-imbued monstrosities. These attacks weren't random acts of violence; they specifically targeted powerful organisations, including the prestigious **Academy**, in a calculated effort by the perpetrators to destabilise society and seize power in the ensuing chaos.

One major casualty of the fallout was the **Grand Library**, once a proud wing of the Academy itself. Abandoned roughly a decade ago due to the escalating danger from mutated creatures drawn to its lingering power, most of its irreplaceable texts were digitised before the doors were sealed. For a time, the Academy repurposed the deserted structure, much like police or firefighters use condemned buildings: it became a proving ground. Mercenaries training under the Academy's banner honed their combat and magical skills within its hazardous halls, but only once they were deemed sufficiently prepared.

The Library's unique danger stems from more than just mutated beasts. It houses the **largest known Source of Ichor in the country** – effectively, a vast, communal wellspring of raw arcane energy. In safer times, it served as a place for mages to Stock spells or Draw new magical knowledge. However, over the years, this potent Source has begun to "leak," saturating the abandoned Library and the creatures within it. This leakage granted the mutated beasts abilities previously thought exclusive to sentient, trained magic users.

Fortunately for those who would face them, these creatures lack true mastery. They cannot consciously Draw from the Source themselves, nor are they adept at guarding their elemental Weaknesses. Yet, this offers little comfort now. Fuelled by the leaking Source, their power has grown exponentially over time. Several years ago, the situation became so perilous that the Academy was forced to cease all training operations within the Library, barring even their most skilled students.

Now, the problem has spiralled completely out of control. The zone of mutated danger surrounding the Library expands daily, threatening nearby civilian populations and Academy resources. The time for containment has passed. Recognising the extreme threat, the Academy has now authorised **you**, their most well-trained and capable mercenary unit, to undertake the critical mission.

Your objective is twofold: **clear the Library of the mutated horrors within, and neutralise the Ichor Source permanently.** While the primary goal regarding the Source is its **destruction**, its immense power means **you will be able to Draw from it directly** – a risky but potentially rewarding prospect. Succeed, and you may halt the tide of mutated beasts; fail, and the destabilising influence of the Abyssal Catalyst and the unchecked Source could endanger the entire region.
