Acquiring spells involves *Drawing* them from enemies.

* **Range:** You must be within attack range of the enemy.
* **Knowledge:** To know what spells an enemy has available to Draw, you must either have prior knowledge or spend Actions to [[Familiarity With Spells#Identifying and Misidentifying Spells|Identify]] them. The GM generally won't reveal Draw Lists freely.
* **On Kill:** Killing an enemy **grants a free Draw** of a random spell from that enemy.
### Draw Action (1 Action):

>[!tip]- First, the target must attempt a [[Saving Throws#Will|Will Save]], with the following DC:

$$ DC = 20 + \text{Caster's Magic stat} $$

  1. Cast **(0 additional Actions):** Immediately attempt to Cast the drawn spell without adding it to inventory. Requires having enough remaining Actions for the **spell's casting cost**, and enough **Mana Points (MP)**. The GM should inform you of the cost beforehand. *See [[Casting Spells]] for more info*
  2. Stock **(2 additional Actions):** Add multiple copies of the drawn spell to your inventory. This costs a total of 3 Actions (1 to Draw + 2 to Stock). See [[#Draw Amount]].
  3. Relinquish **(0 additional Actions):** Do nothing with the spell, returning it to the target. Useful if you can't Cast it (not enough Actions) and don't want to Stock it.

## Draw Amount

When you choose to **Stock** (Option 2 above):

* Roll **1d4** to determine the number of spell charges gained.
* If you have [[Elemental Affinities#Mastery|Mastery]] over the spell's element, roll **2d4** instead.
* Add your [[Stats#üçÄ Luck|Luck]] stat as a flat bonus to the roll result.
	* Example (3 Luck, no Mastery): Roll **\(1d4 + 3\).**
	* Example (3 Luck, with Mastery): Roll **\(2d4 + 3\).**
* The maximum flat bonus from Luck added to the roll is **4**.
* The Luck bonus does not apply if you roll a natural 1.
