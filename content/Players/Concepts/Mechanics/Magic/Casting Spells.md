## Mana Points (MP)

Each player and NPC starts the day with 10 Mana Points - the maximum amount. 

Casting spells requires spending an equal amount of MP as the spell's [[Ranks and Levels#Soul Link Ranks|Soul Link Rank]]: for example, a Rank 3 spell would require using 3 MP to cast. If you have 2 MP, you will be unable to cast that Rank 3 spell until next round.

S-Rank spells require 10 MP to cast.

### Recovering MP

At the start of each ***round*** of combat (not to be confused with each ***turn***) every character in the turn order will regain **3 MP.**

You will also be able to recover **1 MP** if the [[Baton Pass|Baton is passed]] to you.
