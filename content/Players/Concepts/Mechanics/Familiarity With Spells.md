# Familiarity with Spells

To know the identity of a spell when [[Drawing Spells|Drawing]], you must be familiar with it. Unknown spells are not named by the GM.

A spell is considered **familiar** if:

* You or a party member has **used** it before.
* You or a party member has **drawn** it before.
* You or a party member has been **affected** by it obviously (e.g., hit by a Fireball).
* You **started** with it in your inventory.

## Identifying and Misidentifying Spells

If a spell is unfamiliar, you can attempt to identify it.
#### `pf2:1` Recall Knowledge (One Action)
Make an Arcana skill check. The DC is set by the GM based on the spell's [[Ranks and Levels|level]] and rarity.
  * ‚ùó**Critical Success:** Identify the spell, become familiar. Gain a +1 bonus if you Cast this spell with your next Action.
  * ‚úÖ **Success:** Identify the spell, become familiar.
  * ‚ùå **Failure:** Fail to identify; the spell remains unknown.
  * üíî **Critical Failure:** Misidentify the spell (you think it's something else). You become familiar with the *wrong* spell. Misidentified spells are forgotten after combat.

* **Consequences of Misidentification:** If a spell is misidentified, you lose control over whether to Stock or Cast it upon Drawing. You must make a Will save.
  * **Will Save DC:** \( 10 + the Spell's Level \)
  * **Failure or Critical Failure on Will Save:** You are forced to Cast the spell immediately (if possible with remaining Actions).
