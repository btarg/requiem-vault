## Clumsy

Your movements become clumsy and inexact. Clumsy always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to the condition value to [[Stats#🏃 Speed|Dexterity (SPD)]]-based rolls and DCs, including **AC,** [[Saving Throws#Reflex|Reflex saves]] and ranged attack rolls.

## Concealed

You are difficult for one or more creatures to see due to thick fog or some other obscuring feature. You can be concealed to some creatures but not others. While concealed, you can still be observed, but you’re tougher to target. A creature that you’re concealed from must succeed at a **DC 5 flat check** when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect. If the check fails, you aren’t affected. Area effects aren’t subject to this flat check.

## Dazzled

Your eyes are overstimulated or your vision is swimming. If vision is your only precise sense, all creatures and objects are Concealed from you. This means you must succeed a **DC 5 flat check** when targeting with an attack or spell (Area effects aren’t subject to this flat check).

## Frightened

You’re gripped by fear and struggle to control your nerves. The frightened condition always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value to **all your checks and DCs.** Unless specified otherwise, at the end of each of your turns, the value of your frightened condition decreases by 1.

## Quickened

You’re able to act more quickly. **You gain 1 additional action at the start of your turn each round.** Many effects that make you quickened require you use this extra action only in certain ways. If you become quickened from multiple sources, you can use the extra action you’ve been granted for any single action allowed by any of the effects that made you quickened. Because quickened has its effect at the start of your turn, you don’t immediately gain actions if you become quickened during your turn.

## Slowed

You have fewer actions. Slowed always includes a value. **When you regain your actions, reduce the number of actions regained by your slowed value.** Because you regain actions at the start of your turn, you don’t immediately lose actions if you become slowed during your turn.
