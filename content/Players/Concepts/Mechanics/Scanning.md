For **1 Action,** you can roll a [[Stats#👁️ Perception|Perception]] check against a character's AC, and on a **Critical Success** (you exceed the AC by 10, or roll a natural 20), you are given their full list of [[Elemental Affinities]].

For each Failure, you gain a -**1 penalty** to these checks, and a **-2 penalty** on a Critical Failure. These will stack, until you rest.
