Each player and NPC starts the day with 10 Mana Points. At the start of each ***round*** of combat (not to be confused with each ***turn***) every character in the turn order will regain **3 MP.**

Casting spells requires spending an equal amount of MP as the spell's [[Ranks and Levels#Soul Link Ranks|Soul Link Rank]]: for example, a Rank 3 spell would require using 3 MP to cast. If the player has 2 MP, they will be unable to cast that Rank 3 spell until next round.
