## Triggering a Critical Hit

A Critical Hit occurs under these conditions:

1. **Natural 20:** Rolling a natural 20 on an attack roll.
    * _Restriction:_ Does **not** apply to spell attacks, only regular attacks (e.g., weapon strikes).
2. **AC + 10:** Rolling equal to or greater than the target's Armor Class + 10 on an attack roll.
    * _Restriction:_ Does **not** apply to spell attacks, only regular attacks.
3. **Elemental Weakness:** Successfully exploiting the target's [[Elemental Affinities|Elemental Weakness]].
    * _Applies to:_ Both regular attacks and spell attacks.

## One More

Successfully landing a Critical Hit grants the attacker **one additional Action** on their current turn.
This Action is a standard Action and can be used for any activity that normally costs an Action. It is _not_ a free action, reaction, or special "Hasted" action.

You can use the Action yourself, or you can choose to [[Baton Pass|Pass the Baton]] to an ally.

## Knockdown (Prone/Downed) Status

Characters who are critically hit are knocked **Prone** (also referred to as "Downed").

### Rules for Downed Enemies

* **Cannot Be Critically Hit Again:** While Prone, an enemy **cannot** suffer another Critical Hit. Exploiting weaknesses or rolling high against their AC will only result in normal damage while they are Downed.
* `pf2:1` **Standing Up:** Requires the enemy to spend **1 Action**.
* **Critically Hitting a Downed Enemy:** May cause them to stand up if they succeed on a Fortitude save. See [[Difficulty Classes]] for how DCs are determined.
* **Resistance to Repeated Knockdowns:** Each time an enemy is knocked down _within the same encounter_, they gain a cumulative **+2 bonus** to their [[Saving Throws#Fortitude|Fortitude]] saves against subsequent effects that would knock them down.

### Player Character Differences

Players handle critical hits and knockdowns differently:

* **Not Immediately Downed:** When an enemy critically hits a player, the player is **not** automatically knocked Prone.
* **Fortitude Save vs. Knockdown:** The player must immediately roll a **Fortitude save** to resist being knocked down.
  * **Luck Bonus:** Add a flat bonus equal to the player's [[Stats#üçÄ Luck|Luck]] stat to this Fortitude save roll. There is no hard cap on this bonus.
  * **Save DC:** See [[Difficulty Classes]] for how DCs are determined.
  * **Save Outcomes:**
    * ‚ùó **Critical Success:** Avoid being knocked down AND automatically succeed on the _next_ Fortitude save against being knocked down in this encounter.
    * ‚úÖ **Success:** Avoid being knocked down.
    * ‚ùå **Failure:** Knocked Prone/Downed.
    * üíî **Critical Failure:** Knocked Prone/Downed and become **Frightened II**.
* `pf2:1` **Standing Up (Player):**
  * Costs **1 Action** for the player to stand up themselves.
  * An adjacent ally can use **1 Action** to help the downed player stand up.
  * [[Baton Pass|Passing the Baton]] to an adjacent downed ally helps them stand up _and_ grants them the passed Action. (This does not apply if the ally is Dying or Dead).
* **Resistance to Repeated Knockdowns (Player):** Players also gain the cumulative **+2 Fortitude save bonus** against further knockdowns in the same encounter each time they are knocked down.
