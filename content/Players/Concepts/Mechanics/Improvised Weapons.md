To obtain an Improvised Weapon (e.g. a bottle or barstool), succeed these checks:
- [[Stats#🍀 Luck|Luck]] vs DC 8, or [[Stats#👁️ Perception|Perception]] DC 12** - there needs to be an object usable as a weapon nearby
- **[[Stats#🏃 Speed|Speed]] vs DC 15** - you need to be quick to pick it up, or an enemy can attack you with a Reaction

Improvised weapons will require a **Luck check vs DC 10** on every attack, where on failure, the weapon breaks, and on a Critical failure, the weapon breaks and deals **1d4 [[Elements#⚔️ Physical (PHYS)|Phys]] damage to the user.

**The Luck DC increases with the attack penalty.** For example, Attack #2 would require a Luck check **vs DC 11.** The attack penalty also applies to self-damage.

Attack #2 with a Club would do 1d6+2 damage to the enemy on success, or 1d4-1 damage to the player on a Crit fail.


`pf2:1` **Improvised Club:** 1d6+3 [[Elements#⚔️ Physical (PHYS)|Phys]], range 5ft. (-1 penalty for each attack)
`pf2:1` **Improvised Projectile:** 1d4+3 [[Elements#⚔️ Physical (PHYS)|Phys]], range 15ft. (-1 penalty for each attack)
