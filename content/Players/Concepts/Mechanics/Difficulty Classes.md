## Saving Throws against Spells

The DC of [[Saving Throws#Fortitude|Fortitude]] and [[Saving Throws#Will|Will]] saving throws uses the incoming spell's [[Ranks and Levels#Soul Link Ranks|Soul Link Rank]].

**Formula:**
$$ DC = 10 + \text{Soul Link Rank} $$

**Example:**

* When attacked with a spell of [[Ranks and Levels#Soul Link Ranks|Soul Link Rank]] 5, the player would face a DC of \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) when attempting a Fortitude or Will Save against it.
