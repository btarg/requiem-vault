All characters possess strengths and weaknesses based on [[Elements]], similar to *Shin Megami Tensei/Persona*.

Each player will be able to choose the following when creating their character:
- One element to be **WEAK** to
- One element to **RESIST**

## Resistance Factor

Each of the affinities are listed in order from lowest to highest resistance factor. When levelling up, you can choose an [[Elements|Element]] and increase your resistance factor for that particular element.
However, you cannot increase

## Affinity Types
### 0. WEAK
Target takes double damage. Attacker gains 1 additional Action.
### 1. NEUTRAL
No special effect. [[Critical Hits and Knockdowns|Critical Hits]] against the target will act like they are **WEAK,** knocking them down. (See [[Critical Hits and Knockdowns]])
### 2. RESIST
Target reduces incoming damage.
[[Elements#‚öîÔ∏è Physical (PHYS)|Physical]] damage is reduced by [[Stats#üõ°Ô∏èVitality|Vitality]] the character's stat, while Magical damage (any element other than PHYS) is reduced by the character's [[Stats#üíô Spirit|Spirit]] stat.
### 3. NULL
Immune to damage from this element. It does nothing, wasting the attacker's turn.
### 4. DRAIN
The target absorbs incoming damage as HP.
### 5. REFLECT
Damage is bounced back at the attacker. An attack can only be reflected once per instance (no ping-ponging).
