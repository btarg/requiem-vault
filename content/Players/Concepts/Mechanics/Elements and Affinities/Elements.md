Elemental types in this campaign are simplified from standard Pathfinder 2E. If a spell has multiple traits/elements in its original PF2E form, it will be given whichever element seems the most sensible based on its description.
## ⚔️ Physical (PHYS)
Combined Bludgeoning, Piercing and Slashing.
## 💥 Force
Combined Force, Sonic and Air.
## 🔥 Fire
## ❄️ Cold
## ⚡ Electricity (ELEC)
## 🧪 Chemical (CHEM)
Combined Acid and Poison.
## 🌀 Psychic (PSY)
Combined Spirit and Mental from PF2E context, representing mental/emotional effects.
## ✨ Radiant (RAD)
Represents all Light-based spells - including Vitality spells - from PF2E.
## 🌌 Void
Represents all Void, Dark and Negative spells.
## ☄️Almighty
Some attacks will do "Almighty" damage, which means they ignore all [[Elemental Affinities]], acting like NEUTRAL.
