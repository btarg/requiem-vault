All characters possess strengths and weaknesses to [[Elements]]. Combat revolves around exploiting your enemy's weaknesses, and defending against your own.

## Resistance Factor

Each of the affinities are listed in order from lowest to highest resistance factor. Every time you [[Ranks and Levels#Levelling up||level up]] you gain 1 Affinity Point.

With 1 Affinity Point, you can choose an [[Elements|Element]] and increase your resistance factor for that particular element by 1 (e.g. from neutral to resist). However, if you are Weak to an element, you will need **3 (amount not final) Affinity Points** to move to Neutral.

## Affinity Types
### 0. WEAK
Target takes double damage. Attacker gains 1 additional Action.
### 1. NEUTRAL
No special effect. [[Critical Hits and Knockdowns|Critical Hits]] against the target will act like they are **WEAK,** knocking them down. (See [[Critical Hits and Knockdowns]])
### 2. RESIST
Target reduces incoming damage.
[[Elements#⚔️ Physical (PHYS)|Physical]] damage is reduced by the character's [[Stats#🛡️Vitality|Vitality]] stat, while Magical damage (any element other than PHYS) is reduced by the character's [[Stats#💙 Spirit|Spirit]] stat. Critical Hits still act the same.
### 3. NULL
Immune to damage from this element, including Crits. It does nothing, wasting the attacker's turn.
### 4. DRAIN
Same as Null, but the target absorbs the incoming damage as HP.
### 5. REFLECT
Damage is bounced back at the attacker. An attack can only be reflected once per instance (no ping-ponging).
