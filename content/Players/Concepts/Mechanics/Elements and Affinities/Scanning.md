For **1 Action,** you can roll a [[Stats#👁️ Perception|Perception]] check against a character's DC, and on a **Critical Success** (you exceed the DC by 10, or roll a natural 20), you are given their full list of [[Elemental Affinities]].

>[!tip]- The DC for Scanning is the target's **AC + [[Stats#💙 Spirit|their Spirit stat]].**

On a **Success**, you gain information about only one of their affinities which you didn't know before. The element will need to be one that you are familiar with channelling: for example, if you are familiar with a Cold spell, you could ask the GM about their Cold affinity.

For each **Failure**, you gain a -**1 penalty** to these checks, and a **-2 penalty** on a **Critical Failure.** These will stack, until you rest, or succeed a Scan check.

### Misidentifying

On a **Critical Failure,** you will misidentify the enemy's affinities. Specifically on rolling a natural 1, every one of the affinities will be completely inaccurate.
