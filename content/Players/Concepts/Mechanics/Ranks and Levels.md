## Soul Link Ranks

Pathfinder spell levels correspond to *[[Soul Linking Overview|Soul Link]] Ranks,* which are used to determine the [[Formula for Stats]].

* **Rank 1:** Cantrips & Level 1 Spells
* **Rank 2:** Level 2–3 Spells
* **Rank 3:** Level 4–5 Spells
* **Rank 4:** Level 6–7 Spells
* **Rank 5:** Level 8–10 Spells
* **Rank S:** Level > 10 Spells

## Levelling up

Everyone in the party is always at the same level. As the party levels up, you will unlock the ability to Link more [[Stats]]. Whenever you rest, you will be able to swap out which Spells are Linked to which Stats.

You are able to Soul Link a number of Stats corresponding to the party's Level. (Level 5 party = 5 linkable stats at a time).
Since your party will start at Level 1, one stat will be available for Soul Linking from the start of the campaign.

When levelling up, players will also gain **5 skill points,** see [[Stats]].

### The Hoard
Honing your abilities is an investment. All players can pool together money into a "hoard" - permanently investing it into levelling up.

| Level | Hoard Value (GP)  |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1     | 0 gp (no benefit) |
| 2     | 80 gp             |
| 3     | 200 gp            |
| 4     | 400 gp            |
| 5     | 600 gp            |

When you level up, each player also gains one [[Elemental Affinities#Resistance Factor||Affinity Point]].
