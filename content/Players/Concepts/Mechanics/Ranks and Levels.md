## Soul Link Ranks

Pathfinder spell levels correspond to *[[Soul Linking Overview|Soul Link]] Ranks,* which are used to determine the [[Formula for Stats]].

* **Rank 1:** Cantrips & Level 1 Spells
* **Rank 2:** Level 2–3 Spells
* **Rank 3:** Level 4–5 Spells
* **Rank 4:** Level 6–7 Spells
* **Rank 5:** Level 8–10 Spells

## Player Levels

As the party levels up, you will unlock the ability to Link more [[Stats]]. Whenever you [[Rest]], you will be able to swap out which Spells are Linked to which Stats.

You are able to Soul Link a number of Stats corresponding to the party's Level. (Level 5 party = 5 linkable stats at a time)
