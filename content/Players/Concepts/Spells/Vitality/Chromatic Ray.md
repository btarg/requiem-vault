## Description

You send out a ray of shimmering, coloured light streaming toward your enemy, with a magical effect depending on the ray's colour and its manifested elemental nature.

## Mechanics

-   **Range:** 30 feet
-   **Targets:** 1 creature
-   **Traits:** Attack, Light

## Effects

- Make a spell attack roll. If you hit, roll **1d8** to see which beam you cast.
- If the ray acts like another spell, then the player can optionally roll a [[Stats#ðŸ§  Wisdom|Wisdom]] check against **DC 15**, where upon success they become [[Familiarity With Spells|Familiar]] with the spell if they weren't already. 

1.  **Red Ray** ([[Elements#ðŸ”¥ Fire|ðŸ”¥ Fire]])
    *   The ray deals 30 fire damage to the target.
2.  **Orange Ray** ([[Elements#âœ¨ Vitality|âœ¨ Vitality]])
    *   The ray deals 40 vitality damage to the target.
3.  **Yellow Ray** ([[Elements#âš¡ Electricity|âš¡ Electricity]])
    *   The ray deals 50 electricity damage to the target.
4.  **Green Ray** ([[Elements#ðŸ§ª Chemical|ðŸ§ª Chemical]])
    *   The ray deals 25 chemical damage to the target, and the target must succeed at a [[Saving Throws|Fortitude save]] or be **Enfeebled 1** for 1 minute **(Enfeebled 2 on a critical failure).**
5.  **Blue Ray** ([[Elements#ðŸŒŒ Void|ðŸŒŒ Void]])
    *   The ray has the effect of the [[Petrify]] spell.
    *   On a critical hit, the target is **clumsy 1** as long as it's slowed by the *petrify* effect.
6.  **Indigo Ray** ([[Elements#ðŸŒ€ Psychic|ðŸŒ€ Psychic]], Incapacitation)
    *   The ray has the effect of the [[Confusion]] spell.
    *   On a critical hit, it has the effect of [[Warp Mind]] instead.
7.  **Violet Ray** ([[Elements#ðŸ’¥ Force|ðŸ’¥ Force]], Teleportation)
    *   The target is slowed 1 for 1 minute.
    *   It must also succeed at a [[Saving Throws#Will|Will save]] or be teleported 120 feet directly away from you (if there isn't room for it to appear there, it appears in the nearest open space).
8.  **Intense Colour Ray** ([[Elements#âœ¨ Vitality|âœ¨ Vitality]])
    *   The target is **Dazzled** until the end of your next turn, or blinded if your attack roll was a critical hit.
    *   Roll again on this table (rerolling any result of 8) and apply the effects of the new colour ray in addition to the **Dazzled** condition. The additional ray uses the original attack roll and its own elemental type.
