## Description

You rapidly accelerate the natural processes of decay and entropy within a creature's body, causing it to wither and debilitate from within.

## Mechanics

-   **Range:** 30 feet
-   **Targets:** 1 creature
-   **Defence:** Fortitude
-   **Traits:** Uncommon, Concentrate, Manipulate, Oracle, Void

## Effects

-   As the target's body rapidly withers and declines, it takes \(**9d6**\) void damage and must attempt a [[Saving Throws#Fortitude|Fortitude save]].

    -   **Critical Success:** The target is unaffected.
    -   **Success:** The target takes half damage and is your choice of clumsy 1, drained 1, or enfeebled 1 for 1 round.
    -   **Failure:** The target takes full damage and is clumsy 1, drained 1, and enfeebled 1 for 1 round.
    -   **Critical Failure:** The creature takes double damage and is clumsy 1, drained 1, and enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.
