## Description

You inflict a potent curse that accelerates the natural processes of time, causing rapid aging, erosion, and decay in the target.

## Mechanics

-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Targets:** 1 Large or smaller object, construct, or living creature
-   **Defence:** Fortitude
-   **Duration:** Varies
-   **Traits:** Concentrate, Curse, Manipulate, Void

## Effects

-   You curse the target with rapid aging or erosion. The effect depends on whether the target is an object, a construct, or a living creature.
-   Artifacts, along with objects and constructs made of precious materials (as determined by the GM), are immune.

**Targeting a Construct:**
-   The construct takes \(**4d6**\) void damage (basic Fortitude save).
    -   On a failure, for 1 hour, the construct is clumsy 1, is enfeebled 1, and can't be Repaired. The curse also attempts to counteract any spell that would restore the construct's Hit Points.
    -   On a critical failure, these effects have an unlimited duration.

**Targeting a Living Creature:**
-   The living creature must attempt a [[Saving Throws#Fortitude|Fortitude save]]. Ageless creatures are immune.
    -   **Critical Success:** The living creature is unaffected.
    -   **Success:** The living creature briefly ages, becoming clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for 1 round.
    -   **Failure:** As success, with a duration of 1 hour.
    -   **Critical Failure:** As success, with an unlimited duration.

**Targeting an Object:**
-   If the object is attended, its bearer can attempt a [[Saving Throws#Fortitude|Fortitude save]].
-   If the bearer fails or the object is unattended, the object immediately takes \(**4d6**\) void damage (applying Hardness normally), and the item is cursed with an unlimited duration.
-   Until the curse ends, the item becomes shoddy and can't be Repaired, and the curse attempts to counteract any spell that would restore the object's Hit Points.
-   *Cleanse affliction* can target an item affected by this spell.
