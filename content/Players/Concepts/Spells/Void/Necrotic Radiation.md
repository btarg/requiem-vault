-   **If you cast the spell on an area:** Any creature ending its turn in the area takes \(**2d6**\) void damage.
-   You can attempt to use this spell on an attended object by touching the object. If you do, the creature carrying or wearing the object attempts a [[Saving Throws#Reflex|Reflex save]] to reduce the effect.
