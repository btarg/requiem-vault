## Description

You assault a creature's mind, scrambling its mental faculties and distorting its sensory input with potent psychic force.

## Mechanics

-   **Range:** 120 feet
-   **Targets:** 1 creature
-   **Defence:** [[Saving Throws#Will|Will]]

## Effects

-   The target must attempt a [[Saving Throws#Will|Will saving throw.]]
-   Regardless of the result of that save, the target is then temporarily **immune** to Warp Mind for 10 minutes.
-   Warp Mind's effects happen instantly, so [[Dispel Magic]] and other effects that counteract spells can't counteract them.

-   **Critical Success:** The target is unaffected.
-   **Success:** The target spends the first action on its next turn with the confused condition.
-   **Failure:** The target is confused for 1 minute.
-   **Critical Failure:** The target is confused permanently.
