## Description

You exhale corrosive gas, and caustic secretions coat your skin as you transform your body into a shifting form of living, highly reactive chemicals.

## Mechanics

-   **Duration:** 1 minute
-   **Traits:** Chemical, Polymorph, Transmutation, Concentrate, Manipulate

## Effects

-   You transform into a being of living acid, gaining immunity to [[Elements#ðŸ§ª Chemical|ðŸ§ª Chemical]] damage.
-   Any creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or non-reach melee weapon takes **3d6** [[Elements#ðŸ§ª Chemical|ðŸ§ª Chemical]] damage.
-   Your unarmed attacks deal an additional **1d4** [[Elements#ðŸ§ª Chemical|ðŸ§ª Chemical]] damage.
-   The first time each round that you deal chemical damage to a creature in this way (either from being touched/attacked or from your own unarmed attacks), you gain **3d6** temporary Hit Points as your body digests the eroded material and transforms it into a protective chemical layer. When the spell ends, any remaining temporary HP expires as well.
-   Your spells with the [[Elements#ðŸ§ª Chemical|ðŸ§ª Chemical]] element deal one additional die of chemical damage (of the same damage die the spell uses).
-   You can cast *acid splash* (dealing chemical damage) as an innate spell; the splash damage affects all creatures within 15 feet instead of the normal 5 feet.
