## Description

Your patron’s breath becomes a swirling blizzard of obscuring, scouring ice that engulfs and follows your target.

## Mechanics

- **Sustain:** Requires a single action (`pf2:1`) each round to maintain the effect. If not sustained, the spell ends immediately (including any persistent damage).

## Effects

The target attempts a Fortitude save when the spell is first cast.

- **Critical Success:** The target is unaffected, and the spell ends immediately.
- **Success:** The target takes 1d6 ❄️ Cold damage, and the spell ends immediately.
- **Failure:** The target takes 1d6 ❄️ Cold damage and 1d6 persistent ❄️ Cold damage. While the spell is sustained:
  - The target is [[Conditions#Concealed|Concealed]] to all other creatures.
  - All other creatures are [[Conditions#Concealed|Concealed]] to the target.
  - The persistent damage automatically ends when the spell ends (either by failing to Sustain or reaching the maximum duration).
- **Critical Failure:** As failure, but the initial cold damage is 2d6 ❄️ Cold damage, and the persistent cold damage is 2d6 ❄️ Cold damage.
