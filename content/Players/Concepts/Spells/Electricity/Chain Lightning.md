## Effects

-   You discharge a powerful bolt of lightning at the primary target, dealing \(**8d12**\) electricity damage. The target must attempt a basic [[Saving Throws#Reflex|Reflex save.]]
    -   **Critical Success (on save):** The creature takes no damage, and the chain ends.
    -   **Success (on save):** The creature takes half damage.
    -   **Failure (on save):** The creature takes full damage.
    -   **Critical Failure (on save):** The creature takes double damage.
-   After affecting the previous target **(unless the chain ended due to a critical success),** the electricity arcs to another creature within **30 feet** of that target. This new target is then affected as above.
-   The chain continues, jumping to another creature within 30 feet of the most recent target, and so on.
-   You can choose to end the chain at any point.
-   You cannot target the same creature more than once.
-   You must have line of effect to all targets.
-   Roll the damage **only once**; this damage is applied to each target (halving or doubling as appropriate for its saving throw outcome).
-   The chain ends if any one of the targets critically succeeds at its save.

**Heightened (+1)**
