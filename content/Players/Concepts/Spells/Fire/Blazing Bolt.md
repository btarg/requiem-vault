## Description

You unleash a searing ray of fire and heat at your foes, with the option to manifest additional rays by concentrating longer.

## Mechanics

-   **Range:** 60 feet
-   **Targets:** 1 or more creatures
-   **Defence:** AC

## Effects

-   Make a spell attack roll against a single creature.
-   **On a hit (1-action):** The target takes **2d6** [[Elements#ðŸ”¥ Fire|ðŸ”¥ Fire]] damage.
-   **On a critical hit (1-action):** The target takes **double damage.**
-   **Additional Actions:**
    -   For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell (up to 2 additional actions for a total of 3), you can fire an additional ray at a different target.
    -   These attacks each increase your multiple attack penalty, but you don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after you make all the spell attack rolls for Blazing Bolt.
-   **If you spend 2 or more actions Casting the Spell:**
    -   The damage for *each* ray increases to **4d6** [[Elements#ðŸ”¥ Fire|ðŸ”¥ Fire]] damage on a hit.
    -   It still deals double damage on a critical hit.
