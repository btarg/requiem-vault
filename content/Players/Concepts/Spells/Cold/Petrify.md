## Description

You channel frigid energy, causing the target's body to slowly turn into a solid ice statue.

## Mechanics

-   **Traditions:** Arcane, Primal
-   **Range:** 120 feet
-   **Targets:** 1 creature made of organic material
-   **Defence:** Fortitude
-   **Duration:** Varies
-   **Traits:** Concentrate, Cold, Manipulate

## Effects

-   The target's body slowly begins to freeze solid. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.
-   **Critical Success:** The target is unaffected.
-   **Success:** The target is slowed 1 for 1 round as frost begins to form on their body.
### Failure

The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a [[Saving Throws#Fortitude|Fortitude save]] at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition **increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure)** as ice spreads and thickens across their body. 

A successful save **reduces the slowed condition by 1** as some ice cracks away. When a creature becomes fully unable to act due to the slowed condition from this spell, the spell then ends in a flash of frigid blue light, leaving the target frozen solid permanently as they become an ice statue. The spell also ends if the slowed condition is removed, which causes the ice to crack and fall away harmlessly.

-   **Critical Failure:** As failure, but the target is initially slowed 2 as a layer of ice immediately encases them.
