### The fundamental mechanic of this campaign is *Soul Linking.*

* **Spells as Inventory:** Spells function like items. They have no weight, but you have a maximum stock limit (currently **15\***) per spell type. Instead of spell slots, you "draw" magic from enemies. You can cast spells as often as you like during your turn, provided you have the required Actions.
* **Casting Spells:** The Action cost varies by spell power ([[Ranks and Levels|Rank]]). Low-rank spells might cost 1 Action, high-rank spells up to 3 Actions (a full turn).
* **Linking Spells to Stats:** Spells can be Linked to a specific [[Stats|Stat]] to modify the stat's value. Initially, you can only Link to one stat, gaining more linkable stats as you level up. [[Ranks and Levels]].
* **Managing Spell Inventory:** Gaining more of a linked spell increases the corresponding stat bonus. Casting the spell consumes one copy, reducing the bonus. Balancing spell stock is key to maintaining stat boosts. See [[Formula for Stats]].

\* *This limit is not final and may change.*
